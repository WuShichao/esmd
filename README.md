# esmd
It is a computing program in matlab for  ESMD method, which is an extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) method is proposed to improve the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) through the following prospects: (1) The sifting process is implemented by the aid of 1, 2, 3 or more inner interpolating curves, which classifies the methods into ESMD_I, ESMD_II, ESMD_III, and so on; (2) The last residual is defined as an optimal curve possessing a certain number of extreme points, instead of general trend with at most one extreme point, which allows the optimal sifting times and decompositions; (3) The extreme-point symmetry is applied instead of the envelop symmetry; (4) The data-based direct interpolating approach is developed to compute the instantaneous frequency and amplitude. One advantage of the ESMD method is to determine an optimal global mean curve in an adaptive way which is better than the common least-square method and running-mean approach; another one is to determine the instantaneous frequency and amplitude in a direct way which is better than the Hilbert-spectrum method. These will improve the adaptive analysis of the data from atmospheric and oceanic sciences, informatics, economics, ecology, medicine, seismology, and so on.
